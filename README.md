## Overview

This is a clone of every other timestamp conversion site, except probably not as good XD. Hopefully built to be easy to use with keyboard shortcuts for executing.

This is a react app writen with CRA (create-react-app), using MUI for the UI. There are scripts to build and run the website in Docker.
